 However, please note that youâ€™ll be assigned as a staff user with limited access. Unfortunately, you wonâ€™t have admin rights. Hereâ€™s why:



ðŸ”’ Admin Access Restrictions: The admin role controls critical parts of the system, including sensitive data and settings that affect the entire database. Granting full admin rights to everyone would compromise data integrity and potentially disrupt operations.



While you wonâ€™t see all admin functionalities, the staff view still showcases the core capabilities and streamlined workflow designed for daily operations. We hope it provides a glimpse into the powerful features weâ€™ve built to support our team!
